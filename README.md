Bamazon

A node-based app that utilizes a mySQL database. A table of Products was created with items, prices, stock quanities,...etc. The user is asked what they would like, and how much they want. If theres enough in stock, the application will create the order, total the price, and update the database with the new quanity. This app was created using the inquirer npm package.
